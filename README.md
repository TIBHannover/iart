# iART

![](images/iart-salvator.png)


## Overview

The project iART is devoted to the development of an e-Research-tool for digitized, image-oriented research processes in the humanities and cultural sciences. It not only aims to improve the efficiency of retrieval in image databases but also offers various tools for analyzing image data, thereby enhancing scientific work and facilitating new theory formation. The motivation for the project stems from the fundamental importance of the comparative approach in art history, which targets the similarity of pictures and comes along with a rehabilitation of similarity thinking in contemporary philosophy of science. iART is supposed to transfer the approach of art history theorists and practitioners of Comparative Analysis to the digital age, and to extend it by virtue of modern information technology. 


## Installation

At a later point there will be a docker container provided here.


## Development setup


### Requirements
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


### Setup process
1. Clone the iART repository including submodules:
    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TIBHannover/iart.git
    cd iart
    ```

2. Run `install.sh` to download and extract models:
    ```sh
    bash install.sh
    ```

3. Build and start the container:
    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Apply database migrations and build frontend packages:
    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose exec backend python3 manage.py migrate auth
    sudo docker-compose exec backend python3 manage.py migrate
    sudo docker-compose exec frontend npm install
    sudo docker-compose exec frontend npm run build
    ```

5. For demonstration purposes, index `./data/examples/wikipedia_small.jsonl`: 
    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose exec indexer python -m iart_indexer --m client --task indexing --path /data/examples/wikipedia_small.jsonl --image_paths /data/media
    ```

    Wait until the `docker-compose up` process finishes indexing (this may take a few minutes). After that, an index must be created for faster searching and all existing images must be imported into the new index.
    
    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose exec indexer python -m iart_indexer -m client --task faiss_train --port 50151  
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo docker compose exec indexer python -m iart_indexer -m client --task faiss_indexing --port 50151 
    ```

6. Go to the frontend instance at `http://localhost/`.


### Code reloading
Hot reloading is enabled for `backend`. To display frontend changes, run:
```sh
sudo docker-compose exec frontend npm run build
```
Alternatively, use `serve` to enable a hot reloaded instance on `http://localhost:8080/`:
```sh
sudo docker-compose exec frontend npm run serve
```
